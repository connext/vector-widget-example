# Vector Modal Widget Example

This is a minimal example of a React app to use the Vector [widget](https://github.com/connext/vector-modal).

# Using the Example

- Clone the repo.
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- Modify the `ConnextModal` component props in `src/index.tsx` as needed. By default it points to Connext's hosted router.
- Run `npm start` to start the app.
- Either add on to build a full application using this example as a starting point, or use it to test out a router and get familiar with providing liquidity.
